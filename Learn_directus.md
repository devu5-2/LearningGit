## What is Directus?
-> Directus is an open-source data platform that provides a headless CMS (Content Management System) and API-first solution for managing and distributing content. 
It is designed to work seamlessly with relational databases, offering a no-code or low-code interface to manage your data, while also providing a flexible API for developers.

## No-Code/Low-Code Interface:
A user-friendly admin app lets non-technical users manage content and data without needing to write any code.

Built-in user authentication, role-based permissions, and granular access control ensure secure data management.

Directus supports extensions, hooks, and custom APIs, allowing you to extend functionality as needed.
